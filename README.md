# Meal-Match
This javascript based web-app uses a tinder-like approach to figure out the age old question "where are we going to eat?" The code for this project is actually hosted on my personal github page at [cubetures.github.io](https://cubetures.github.io). This project was created for fun in my first semester of college.
