# Meal-Match
This javascript based web-app uses a tinder-like approach to figure out the age old question "where are we going to eat?" The code for this project is actually hosted on my personal github page at [cubetures.github.io](https://cubetures.github.io). This project utilizes a variety of APIs including the following Google APIs: Firebase Authentication API, Firebase Realtime Database API, Google Places (New) API, Google Reverse Geocoding API, and Google Address Validation API. This project was created for fun in my first semester of college.
